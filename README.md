# DAND-Investigate-a-dataset
In this project, I'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. 

I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which will make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier. Also, these are good skills to impress employers!

# Step One - Choose Your Data Set

I chose the tmdb-movies dataset which is has data regarding movies and there budgets and revunes and much more.\

# Step Two - Organizing the Data Set

I've created a folder that contains:

1.A report communicating my findings

2.The Python coed

3.The dataset

# Step Three - Analying the data

In this step I did the data analysis process regarding wrangling the data and doing various analysis processes

# Step Four - The findings

In this step I discussed my findings and visualized the results obtained in the previous step.
